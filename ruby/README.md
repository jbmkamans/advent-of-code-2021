## Why Ruby?

I'm using Ruby, because I'm quite rusty with it and I would like to improve my Ruby skills.

I learned Ruby on Rails during my final internship, and have used it in my subsequent job for a few years, but that is 
already more than a year ago.

Last year I mainly used Java and JS, with a little bit of Python on the side, so maybe I will also be posting solutions 
using those languages, and if I'm feeling particularly adventurous I will try a solution using VBA.
